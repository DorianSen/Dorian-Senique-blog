| General topic?               | The article is about a new process which helps cells to develop in a correct way with the helps of scaffolds made out of proteins.                      |
| Procedure/what was examined? | The researchers uses 3D printing technology to print structures. they are special structure because it countains polypeptides which provides cues for the cell to behave in a specific way. The reseachers led a study about cartilage and bones in order to find a way to recreate the innitial anchor between 2 types of tissues in case of injury or stress with the help of this technology|
| Conclusions/discovery?       |  It is possible to handle the developpement of stem cell by using this technology of scaffolds in order to improve some medical cares.     |
| Remaining questions?         | The proccess of the farbication involve, according to the reseachers,some modifications after the creation which can also involve unwanted outcomes |
