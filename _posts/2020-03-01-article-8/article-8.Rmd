| General topic        | The article talks about a new kind of material created by bioinspiration. The superhydrophobic features of plants are used to inovate in this case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Procedure            | Researchers from Texas A&M University worked on the inherent characteristics of plants, they studied the molecular structure of the coating of the organisms and they applied patterns such as hexagonal packed layer which confere repel water adherence (at the atom scale), That's why they called the pattern 'nanoflower'. With this technology the researchers created 2D nanomaterials, 2D nanomaterials are an ultrathin class of nanomaterials.                                                                                                     |
| Conclusion/discovery | The found out that it's was possible to apply this discovery in severals fields such as the medical field. Moreover, superhydrophobic coating can be applied over various substrates such as glass, tissue paper, rubber or silica using the solvent evaporation method.  The research shows that nanoflowers coating can be used as well in nanotechnology for an auto-cleaning use but also il the medical uses, indeed, the study showed that blood and cell culture media containing proteins do not adhere to the surface, which could be very usefull. |
