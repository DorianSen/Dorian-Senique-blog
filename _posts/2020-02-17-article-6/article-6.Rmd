| General topic        | The researchers are working on specific ways to control friction of soft materials such as tires, they are working for an enterprise,Michelin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Procedure            | They applied ideas of previous researches in manufacturing tires for the enterprise, thoses ideas were investigating the biological adhesion mechanisms in geckos, lizards and frogs, but they are now applying this to the industry so they had to adapt some things such as the work scale, in laboratory they were working at the micron scale but to ease the manufacturing aspect they are now working at the millimeter scale. To achieve their goal, the researchers fell back on two mechanisms, Meso-scale dislocation arrays and a new form of elastic hysteresis. Thoses are used in industry to control braking performance. |
| Conclusion/discovery | The results of their work is roughly satisfying because it is a challenge but they have to be very careful about the least changement in their parameters in view of a safety aspect.
