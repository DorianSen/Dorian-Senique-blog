| General topic ?        |  This article talks about a new technology of suction cup which are improved by using biomimicry. The organism studied is a clingfish which has a sucker for attachement to underwater AND outside the water substrate. The researchers have imitated the morphological assets of this little fish in order to create an exeptionnal device able to handle heavy objects or archeological artefact by exemple.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Conclusions/discovery? | The reseachers of The university of San Diego found out the secret of the incredible attachement abilities of the clingfish. The section cup of the clingfish is lined with rows of hexagonal structures called papillea,covered with microscopic fibers.  To achieve their goal, the researchers mimicked the fish by incorporing very thin layer made out of silicon and slits in their artificial section cup. The results of the experiences were very successful, the device is able to stick on rough, irregular, concave surface underwater AND outside the water! and also able to hold heavy objects during hours!   |
