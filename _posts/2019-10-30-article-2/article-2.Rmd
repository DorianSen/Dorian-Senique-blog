| General topic?          | This paper is about a new kind of robot called "soft robot" which are directly inspired by the moves of the sticky tongue of animals like chameleon,toads etc when they are predating.These soft robots are made out of polymers. They have the property of retrieving, they are sort of elastic structure which can grab, with an high speed, heavy objects and researchers find it very interesting because of several applications to come in industry.  |
|  Conclusions/discovery? | The researchers found a new kind of mechanical moving  strategy bioinspired by nature  that could revolutionize  many application in the industrial use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
