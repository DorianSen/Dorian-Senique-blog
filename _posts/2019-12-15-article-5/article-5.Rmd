| General topic?       | The article is about a new discovery about structure of human bones. This finding could be useful in medical and industrial sector because we can now understand the secret of the microscopic strucure of bones which provides strenght and sunstainability.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Procedure ?          | The researchers have inflicted strains to bones in order to discover where were the areas concerned in rigidity and sustainability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Conclusion/discovery | By applying this strains, they found out, in the one hand, that the RIGIDITY lay in the vertical struts from the trabecular structure and in the other hand, that the SUSTAINABILITY lay in the horizontal struts of these structures.  The issue is, in this case, a huge application in medical and industrial sector because engineers are now able to recreate accurately these structures by printing them in 3D which is very useful for thoses applications. |
